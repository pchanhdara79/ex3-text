As you read the text, consider its role and its content. The text itself will seem a little random, because you need opportunities to use lots of different tags.

    Here is an interesting story about a popular sport outside of the United States: cricket.

      A gutsy Beth Mooney has guided the Brisbane Heat to a three-wicket upset of the Sydney Sixers to claim their maiden 
      <abbr title="Women's Big Bash League">WBBL</abbr> title at Drummoyne Oval. Laura Harris hit the winnings runs with four balls remaining when she smashed a four between Erin Burns and Sara McGlashan.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being set 132 for victory and needing five off the final over, Harris and Delissa Kimmince guided the underdogs over the line against the two-time reigning champions. However Mooney was the hero, defying illness to hit a match-winning 65 off 46 balls in front of a sold out crowd of 5,368 – and several hundred more watching from vantage points outside the suburban ground in Sydney’s inner west.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being outstanding behind the stumps during the Sixers’ knock – taking two catches including a ripper to dismiss Erin Burns – Mooney was visibly struggling in the stifling heat. The Brisbane trainers on several occasions ran out drinks to the left-hander and she was frequently down on her haunches.
